# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - I found myself pleasantly challenged when I didn't know how to do something, and even more so, when I can't find my question specifically on Google. It's so easy to spend so much time trying to figure out something if you don't know what it's called or if it even exists (because I also don't know what I don't know). But overall, as frustrating as it can get, I have enjoyed the CFU challenges.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - I think it depends on what I'm working on and how I feel. Sometimes taking breaks is so helpful in staying focused, when other times, I don't want to take a break because I am focused.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
    - I definitely need to prioritize rest so that physically and mentally, I can make the most of my time. I know that I will need a lot of support from my husband to take care of life things and also support from my cohort-mates.
